Differences between int and Integer in Java:

1. A int is a data of primitive type while an Integer is an object of a wrapper class .
2. "int" takes 32 bits while "Integer" takes 128 bits.
3. "int" is less flexible than "Integer".
4. "int" can accept integer or binary number and can cast a floating number, "Integer" can even accept a string of number.

Their differences in functionalities:

1. "Integer" can convert an integer into an object and vice verse. "int" can not. 
2. An Integer can be used in collections with object reference or generics. "int" can not.
3. "Integer" can convert a string of integer, but "int" can cast a floating number. 
4. "Integer" can convert to other bases like binary, octal, or hexadecimal. "int" can not.
5. "Integer" can do some bitwise operations, such as reverse(), rotateLeft(), rotateRight().
